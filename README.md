# Contributing

### Contributions are welcome, but if you work on a new feature please create an issue with the feature you plan to implement, and how you will implement it to prevent other people from wasting their time.

#### We recommend that you use an editor that supports [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), the code formatting extension, to keep code style consistent. We also recommend that you stick to standard JavaScript and CSS, rather than TypeScript or SCSS/SASS.

### The TL;DR on the code style is:
- No semicolons (sorry)
- Double quotes (") for multi character strings, single quotes (') for single character strings
- Indent size of 2
- camelCase variable naming
- PascalCase component naming
- No trailing commas
- Use [next/link/Link](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link) instead of standard "<\a>" tags
